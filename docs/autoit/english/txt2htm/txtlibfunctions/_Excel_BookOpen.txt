###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	an workbook object. @extended is set to 1 if $bReadOnly = False but read-write access could not be granted. Please see the Remarks section for details.
Failure:	0 and sets @error.
@error:	1 - $oExcel is not an object or not an application object
	2 - Specified $sFilePath does not exist
	3 - Unable to open $sFilePath. @extended is set to the COM error code returned by the Open method
@@End@@

###Remarks###
When you set $bReadOnly = False but the document can't be opened read-write @extended is set to 1.
The Workbook was opened read-only because it has already been opened by another user/task or the file is set to read-only by the filesystem.
If you modify the workbook you need to use _Excel_BookSaveAs() to save it to another location or with another name.

When setting $bVisible = False when opening a Workbook make sure to set the Workbook to visible again before saving the Workbook.
Use $oExcel.Windows($oWorkbook.Name).Visible = True to make the Workbook visible again.
Else the Workbook will not be shown when you manually open it using Excel.
Most of the time this parameter is not needed. Using $bVisible = False in _Excel_Open is the preferred way.

If $bUpdateLinks is set to Default the user is only prompted if $bDisplayAlerts is set to True in function _Excel_Open.
If $bDisplayAlerts is set to False, Excel chooses the default response.
