###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$oWorkbook
	Excel workbook object
$vWorksheet
	Name, index or worksheet object to be written to. If set to keyword Default the active sheet will be used
$vValue

###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	the object of the range the data has been written to.
Failure:	0 and sets @error.
@error:	1 - $oWorkbook is not an object or not a workbook object
	2 - $vWorksheet name or index are invalid or $vWorksheet is not a worksheet object. @extended is set to the COM error code
	3 - $vRange is invalid. @extended is set to the COM error code
	4 - Error occurred when writing a single cell. @extended is set to the COM error code
	5 - Error occurred when writing data using the _ArrayTranspose function. @extended is set to the COM error code
	6 - Error occurred when writing data using the transpose method. @extended is set to the COM error code
@@End@@

###Remarks###
If $vRange is a single cell and $vValue is an array then $vRange is extended to hold the full array.
This "expanded" range is then returned by the function.
If $vRange is not a single cell and $vValue is an array and $vValue &gt; $vRange then the array gets truncated.
If $vRange is not a single cell and $vValue is an array and $vValue &lt; $vRange then the exceeding cells get #NV.

The Excel transpose method has an undocumented limit on the number of cells or rows it can transpose (dependant on the Excel version).
The Excel transpose method doesn't support cells with more than 255 characters. Set $bForceFunc = True to bypass this limitation(s).
