###ReturnValue###
@@ReturnTable@@
Success:	a variable pointing to the document object. @extended is set to 1 if $bReadOnly = False but read-write access could not be granted. Please see the Remarks section for details.
Failure:	sets the @error flag to non-zero.
@error:	1 - $oAppl is not an object
	2 - The specified document does not exist
	3 - Error occurred when opening specified document. @extended is set to the COM error code
@@End@@

###Remarks###
When you set $bReadOnly = False but the document can't be opened read-write @extended is set to 1.
The document was opened read-only because it has already been opened by another user/task or the file is set to read-only by the filesystem.
If you modify the document you need to use _Word_DocSaveAs() to save it to another location or with another name.
