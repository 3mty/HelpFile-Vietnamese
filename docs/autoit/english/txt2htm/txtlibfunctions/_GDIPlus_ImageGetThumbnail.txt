###Remarks###
A thumbnail image is a small copy of an image. Some image files have a thumbnail image embedded in the file. In such cases, this method retrieves the embedded thumbnail image. If there is no embedded thumbnail image, this method creates a thumbnail image by scaling the main image to the size specified in the thumbWidth and thumbHeight parameters. If both of those parameters are 0, a system-defined size is used.
Don't forget to dispose the thumbnail imgage using _GDIPlus_ImageDispose().
