###User Defined Function###
_WinAPI_CreateEvent

###Description###
Creates or opens a named or unnamed event object

###Syntax###
#include <WinAPI.au3>
_WinAPI_CreateEvent ( [$tAttributes = 0 [, $bManualReset = True [, $bInitialState = True [, $sName = ""]]]] )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
$tAttributes
	[optional] a $tagSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure or a pointer to it. If 0, the handle cannot be inherited by child processes.
	The Descriptor member of the structure specifies a security descriptor for the new event.
	If $tAttributes is 0, the event gets a default security descriptor.
	The ACLs in the default security descriptor for an event come from the primary or impersonation token of the creator.
$bManualReset
	[optional] If True, the function creates a manual-reset event object, which requires the use of the ResetEvent function to set the event state to nonsignaled.
	If False, the function creates an auto-reset event object and system automatically resets the event state to nonsignaled after a single waiting thread has been released.
$bInitialState
	[optional] If True, the initial state of the event object is signaled; otherwise, it is nonsignaled
$sName
	[optional] The name of the event object. Name comparison is case sensitive.
	If $sName matches the name of an existing named event object, this function requests the EVENT_ALL_ACCESS access right.
	In this case the $bManualReset and $bInitialState parameters are ignored because they have already been set by the creating process.
	If the $tAttributes parameter is not 0, it determines whether the handle can be inherited, but its security-descriptor member is ignored.
	If Name is blank, the event object is created without a name.

###ReturnValue###

Success:	The handle to the event object.
	If the named event object existed before the function call the function returns a handle to the existing object and GetLastError returns ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS.
