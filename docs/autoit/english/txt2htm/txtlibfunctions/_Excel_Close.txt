###Remarks###
If Excel was started by _Excel_Open() then _Excel_Close() closes all workbooks
(even those opened manually by the user for this instance after _Excel_Open()) and closes the specified Excel instance.
If _Excel_Open() connected to an already running instance of Excel then you have to set $bForceClose to True to do the same.
