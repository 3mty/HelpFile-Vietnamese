###Function###
Sleep

###Description###
Pause script execution.

###Syntax###
Sleep ( delay )

###Parameters###
@@ParamTable@@
delay
	Amount of time to pause (in milliseconds).
@@End@@

###ReturnValue###
None.

###Remarks###
Maximum sleep time is 2147483647 milliseconds (24 days) and the minimum is 10 milliseconds. So using 1-9 will automatically default to 10 milliseconds.

Due to internal implementation, the sleep time completion is checked every 10 milisseconds so the precision cannot be less than 10.
Note that other running processes often affect the timing accuracy and so pauses are likely to last for slightly longer than requested.

###Related###
None.
