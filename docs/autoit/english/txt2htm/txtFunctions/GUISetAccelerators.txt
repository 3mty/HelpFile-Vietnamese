Success:	1.
Failure:	0.

###Remarks###
Accelerator keys are similar to HotKeys, but there are 2 important differences:

	- 1. They are only active when the GUI specified in the function is active which means that, unlike HotKeys, Accelerator keys will not interfere with other running applications.

	- 2. They cannot fire a function directly - they action their associated control which then fires the function using <a href="GUIGetMsg.htm">GUIGetMsg()</a> or <a href="GUICtrlSetOnEvent.htm">GUICtrlSetOnEvent()</a>. If there is no suitable control available in the GUI then a dummy control can be created using <a href="../functions/GUICtrlCreateDummy.htm">GUICtrlCreateDummy</a>.

The array passed as a parameter to this function contains the Accelerator keys and the ControlIDs of the associated controls. The array must be defined as Local/Global $aArray[n][2] - where n is the number of Accelerator keys to set:

	$aArray[0][0] = 1st Accelerator key (in <a href="HotKeySet.htm">HotKeySet()</a> format)
	$aArray[0][1] = Associated ControlID for 1st accelerator, as returned by <a href="../functions/GUICtrlCreate Management.htm">GUICtrlCreate...</a>
	$aArray[1][0] = 2nd Accelerator key
	$aArray[1][1] = Associated ControlID for 2nd accelerator
	...
	$aArray[n][0] = nth Accelerator key
	$aArray[n][1] = Associated ControlID for the nth accelerator


Passing this function a non-array parameter will unset all accelerators for the specified winhandle.
